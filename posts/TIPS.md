On Life:
- Grades don't matter as much as relationships. Having the ability to make quality friends and to be a good person matters worlds more than a 100 As.
- Grades are very important, up until the beginning of college. Then learning to learn things becomes far more useful. This advice is probably tailored to the United States.
- I have known love, and I have known hate. Hate is more powerful than love for short periods of time. Otherwise, love wins every time. Learning to hate is useful only for edge cases that you may or may not encounter in life. Learning to love is useful to everyone and for all time.
- Listen to people more knowledgeable than you, and read a lot. Reading and listening helps you gain other's experiences for the price of time. You can live multiple lifetimes and not gain as much experience as you would by reading and listening, because different people encounter different scenarios.

On Code:
- Your backend should be as slim as possible. It should handle REST calls, do some small business logic, and then write immediately to the database. If you have a fat backend codebase, you are in trouble. Or you are Google.
- Do engineers prefer working on the latest frameworks or on good code? **Good code, 100% of the time.** Maybe one of the reasons engineers prefer the latest frameworks is because most long-lived codebases have tons of crud, and codebases based on new frameworks just don't have as much crud. But a crud-free old codebase will beat out a cruddy new codebase every time.
- You should be able to completely burn down your frontend, and in the long-term, lose nothing but time (and ideally as little time as possible). You may be able to burn down your backend in the early years, and you should be able to burn it down without losing too much, but you should not need to. If you even think about burning down your database, you are lost.
- Your company should have enough moat around it to be able to refactor your entire codebase every three years. If you don't, you're not in a big or safe enough space.

- These are rules of thumb. If you think of following them, you are on my track. If not, carve your own.
